            <p>Growing up in the Pacific Northwest influenced Jerry's Hobbies greatly. Many of Jerry's hobbies are outdoor activities, including hiking, rafting, and mountain biking. 
              <br><br>
              Jerry will go on hiking trails that most people would find to be extreme. One of his favorite trails that he has been on is <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/enchantment-lakes">the Enchantments</a>, which has over 7000 feet of elevation gain in a relatively short amount of time.
              <br> <br>
              He also will often go rafting when the weather allows it, with the Rogue and Deschutes river being some of his favorites. He has rafted these rivers so many times that he can effectively guide newcomers, and has memorized many of the more difficult rapids.
              <br><br>
              Mountain Biking is another common pasttime for Jerry, and he has enjoyed the sport long enough to watch mountain bikes improve greatly overtime. He also will purchase and fix mountain bikes to re-sell, causing his garage to be filled with at least 30 bikes at any given time.
